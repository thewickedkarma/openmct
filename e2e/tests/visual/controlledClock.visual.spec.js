/*
Collection of Visual Tests set to run in a default context. The tests within this suite
are only meant to run against openmct's app.js started by `npm run start` within the
`./e2e/playwright-visual.config.js` file.

These should only use functional expect statements to verify assumptions about the state
in a test and not for functional verification of correctness. Visual tests are not supposed
to "fail" on assertions. Instead, they should be used to detect changes between builds or branches.

Note: Larger testsuite sizes are OK due to the setup time associated with these tests.
